# PCF
PCF (PowerApps component framework) empowers professional developers and app makers to create code components for model-driven apps and canvas apps to provide an enhanced user experience for the users to view and work with data in forms, views, and dashboards.
For example:
1. Replace a field that displays a numeric text value with a dial or slider code component.
2. Transform a list into an entirely different visual experience bound to the data set like a Calendar or Map.
